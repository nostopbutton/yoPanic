<h3>OUR PRICING POLICY</h3>

<p>
    Currently prices on our website are shown in HK Dollars (HKD $) only and this particular point in time, we ship only
    on a <em>Delivery Duty UNPAID basis</em>. This means that as the recipient of the goods, you are liable for all
    import duties, customs and local sales taxes levied by the country you are shipping to. Import duty or tax costs
    will be invoiced to you directly and payment of these is necessary to release your order from customs on arrival.
    AURZA has no control over these charges and so unfortunately we cannot predict what they might be. If you refuse
    delivery of the shipment you will also be responsible for payment of all return duties and taxes and these will be
    billed to the original method of payment. Please contact your local customs office if you would like to find out
    more.

<h3>PROMOTIONAL/ GIFT VOUCHER CODES</h3>

<p>
    Promotion codes are non-transferable and they cannot be redeemed for cash. Each promotional code can only be used
    once and promotional codes cannot be combined. For certain promotional codes, we will provide a date by which time
    the code must used and we will not accept these codes after the date that we publish.
</p>

<h3>ORDERS AND PAYMENT</h3>

<p>
    AURZA will store a record of your transactions for a minimum of one year.
</p>

<p>
    Once you have placed your order, you will receive an email of acknowledgement from AURZA. We will then process your
    order, wrap your items up and get your order on its way. We will then email you to confirm that your order has been
    despatched. At this point, your order is finally accepted and the contract between you and AURZA is complete.
</p>

<p>In the rare event that you do not fulfil the eligibility criteria that we have set out in these Terms and Conditions,
    we reserve the right not to accept your order. We may also refuse to process or accept a transaction for any reason
    or refuse service to any customer at any time at our sole discretion. However, our goal at all times is to provide
    great customer service and we will work with each and every customer to resolve any issues that we encounter.
</p>

<p>Payment can be made by PAYPAL.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, we take reasonable care, in so far as it is in our power to do so, to keep the details of your order and
    payment secure, but in the absence of negligence on our part we cannot be held liable for any loss you may suffer if
    a third party procures unauthorized access to any data you provide when accessing or ordering from the Site.

    Until each order is delivered to the address that you have specified, it is under the responsibility of AURZA. You
    or any other person that you have designated e.g. the recipient of a gift order, may sign for your goods. However,
    once a signature is obtained for the goods at the address you have specified, responsibility for your purchase
    passes to you.
</p>
