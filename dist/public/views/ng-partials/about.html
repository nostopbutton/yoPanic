            We founded AURZA out of a frustration of never being able to find the clothes
            we really wanted. After having six kids, clothes shopping had lost its sparkle,
            left us deflated and there was always a compromise – too short, too baggy,
            too expensive or even too plain.

      <p>So our aim is simple - to allow women like us to create extraordinary clothes
        that reflect their own sense of style whilst both flattering and fitting each
        of our unique bodies. We want everyone to be able to step out with confidence
        day and night, feeling a million dollars and we know from personal experience
        that a great outfit can make all the difference.</p>

      <p>We are starting by offering utterly fabulous custom made dresses and separates
        <b>designed by us and perfected by you</b>. You choose the style and simply change
        the bodice, skirt, sleeves, length, fabric, trims and accessories. </p>

      <p>Once you have experienced custom from the comfort of your own home you will
        always want to feel this good.</p>

      <p>At the heart of ‘AURZA’ is our relentless desire to make clothes that flatter
        and fit. With six kids between us (and bodies not quite like they used to be) we
        know that well-made tailored clothing make an incredible difference between
        looking hot or not.</p>

      <p>Unlike most off the shelf garments available, our designs are based on revolutionary
        3D body-scanning and pattern making technology that accurately reflect every curve
        in a women’s body. We have tested each of our silhouettes and sizes not on an industry
        ‘fit model’ but on real women with wide ranging body shapes to ensure our designs and
        fabric choices are as flattering as possible. That’s why in our sizing chart you will
        see a small range of measurements for each size which reflect the flexibility of fit /
        stretch within each garment. </p>

      <p>Finally, we really do get that everyone is unique and with four simple measurements (your
        height, bust, waist and hips) we can work with our pattern master to adapt our standard sizing to
        ensure optimal drape and fit. You share your concerns and we will work through a solution
        that works for you.</p>
