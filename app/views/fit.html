      <p>At the heart of ‘BRAZEN’ is our relentless desire to make clothes that flatter
        and fit. With 5 kids between us (and bodies not quite like they used to be) we
        know that well-made tailored clothing make an incredible difference between
        looking hot or not.</p>

      <p>Unlike most off the shelf garments available, our designs are based on revolutionary
        3D body scanning and pattern making technology that accurately reflect every curve
        in a women’s body. We have tested each of our silhouettes and sizes not on an industry
        ‘fit model’ but on real women with wide ranging body shapes to ensure our designs and
        fabric choices are as flattering as possible. That’s why in our sizing chart you will
        see a small range of measurements for each size which reflect the flexibility of fit /
        stretch within each garment. </p>

      <p>Finally, we really do get that everyone is unique and with 2 simple measurements (your
        height and bust) we can work with our pattern master to adapt our standard sizing to
        ensure optimal drape and fit. Long body – no problem, bigger top than bottom – we
        can mix and match sizing. You share your concerns and we will work through a solution
        that works for you and even use all of your body measurements for a full bespoke size
        if that is what it takes.</p>
