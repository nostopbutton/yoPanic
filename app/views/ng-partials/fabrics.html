          Our flattering viscose crepe fabric has been carefully selected because of

          its stretch, drape and softness. The inherent stretch of the twisted yarns gives

          superior comfort to the wearer and the mix with polyester and elastane adds

          further strength, stretch recovery and easy care properties.
