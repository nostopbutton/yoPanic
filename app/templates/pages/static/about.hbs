            <!--We founded AURZA out of a frustration of never being able to find the clothes-->
            <!--we really wanted. After having six kids, clothes shopping had lost its sparkle,-->
            <!--left us deflated and there was always a compromise – too short, too baggy,-->
            <!--too expensive or even too plain.-->

            <p>We knew what we wanted but we could never find it. We spent precious time in stores and online getting it
                almost right. We spent time looking at our purchases in our wardrobe, yet never wearing them.</p>

            <p>We wanted that capsule wardrobe that every fabulous person, except us, has. We wanted to take anything
                from our wardrobe, wear it and feel fabulous. We didn’t want to do the thing where all of our clothes
                are on the bed and we declare (read, scream) “I have nothing to weeeeeaaaarrr”. We wanted to shop online
                and be confident of quality and fit. We wanted to have a personal relationship with a brand that
                wouldn’t let us down.</p>

            <p>We decided to take action. For us, our husbands, our friends and you, and so...</p>
