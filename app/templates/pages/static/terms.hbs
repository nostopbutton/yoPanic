<h3>OUR PRICING POLICY</h3>

<p>
    Currently prices on our website are shown in HK Dollars (HKD $) only and this particular point in time, we ship only
    on a <em>Delivery Duty UNPAID basis</em>. This means that as the recipient of the goods, you are liable for all
    import duties, customs and local sales taxes levied by the country you are shipping to. Import duty or tax costs
    will be invoiced to you directly and payment of these is necessary to release your order from customs on arrival.
    AURZA has no control over these charges and so unfortunately we cannot predict what they might be. If you refuse
    delivery of the shipment you will also be responsible for payment of all return duties and taxes and these will be
    billed to the original method of payment. Please contact your local customs office if you would like to find out
    more.
